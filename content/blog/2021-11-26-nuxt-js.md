# **Vue.js**

If you are used to creating a lot of development projects, you have probably already wondered which tools would be the best and most efficient to assist in this function. Is it React, Vue or Angular?

Who knows that framework you hear so much about would not be the best choice, or maybe that one which has just been released,  would solve all your problems?

It's easy to get lost in the middle of so many options and end up making the wrong choices, and that's not a bad thing, as every mistake becomes new learning and improvement for the next project.

To help you with this decision, we'll talk about a very consolidated tool and with a large number of contributors, you may have heard about it: Vue.js.

###### The Pros and Cons

* Component re-usability.
* All the components are stored in separate files and each one of them is just a single file, so the code becomes easier to read and understand as well easier to maintain and fix.
* It allows developers to write a template in a HTML and  JS file using virtual Node.
* It has a circumstantial documentation wich can fasten the learning curve for developers and save a lot of time to develop an app using only the basics knowledge of HTML and JS.  

### Who is using Vue.js:

* Facebook
* Netflix
* Xiaomi
* Adobe
