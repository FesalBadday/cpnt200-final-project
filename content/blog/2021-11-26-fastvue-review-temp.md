1. Evan: Enjoyed learning Nuxt for the most part, I think because of the amount of time we had to learn it in class I’m still a little unsure of all the ins and outs. I enjoy doing Vue and working with components and the pages they load to. Tailwind seems interesting, I’m not sure if I enjoy using it but I guess we’ll see after this project! Maybe this site will look nice, maybe it’ll be a disgusting mess.
2. Fesal: I enjoyed working with Nuxt and I can see how it could save me time, like doing multiple pages and then just simply calling them from the components. I enjoyed working with both v-for and mustache syntaxes, I did work with v-html/v-text but in future, I don't see any benefit of using v-html/v-text over the mustache? also, one thing I did not like about the v-for is that it's not as simple as the regular for loop just like in JS, don't get me wrong, it's easy once you do it and you get it to work but I still prefer the regular for loop.
3. Mysia: What I have like most about this project was the usability of the components and how they work together...
