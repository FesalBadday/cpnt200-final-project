description: A overview from four Web Development Students about Vue.js, Nuxt.js
  and Tailwind CSS.

In the last two weeks we as Web Development students, at SAIT (Southern Institute of Technology), we have been exposed to several features of these three frameworks.

With all the new libraries and frameworks it is pretty hard to keep up with all of them, and that is if you can even decide which ones are worth spending time one. VueJS is gaining continuous popularity lately and considered as one of the best JavaScript (JS ) framework.

For developers who have experience Vue.js and also for those who want to change areas, there are many opportunities with **Vue.js, Tailwind CSS and Nuxt.js.**

To put it into context, we have to make it clear that this article is not about the perfect choice that will work for all cases without exception, even why this tool has yet to be created. We will be presented here a short overview about the  ones of the most trending and robust solutions used for creating websites and that, for sure, can be the solution to some of your current pains. Doesn't matter if you are a Junior or Senior Developer.

Here some impressions from this unique team:

 *"Enjoyed learning Nuxt for the most part, I think because of the amount of time we had to learn it in class I’m still a little unsure of all the ins and outs. I enjoy doing Vue and working with components and the pages they load to. Tailwind seems interesting, I’m not sure if I enjoy using it but I guess we’ll see after this project! Maybe this site will look nice, maybe it’ll be a disgusting mess."* **(Evan Burton).**                      

*"I enjoyed working with Nuxt and I can see how it could save me time, like doing multiple pages and then just simply calling them from the components. I enjoyed working with both v-for and mustache syntaxes, I did work with v-html/v-text but in future, I don't see any benefit of using v-html/v-text over the mustache? also, one thing I did not like about the v-for is that it's not as simple as the regular for loop just like in JS, don't get me wrong, it's easy once you do it and you get it to work but I still prefer the regular for loop."* **(Fesal Badday).**

*"What I've like most about this Vue.js was the usability of the components and how they work together. Tailwindcss it's seemed to be complicated at the first sight but it gets easier to use as it has a very long and easy documentation, however it certainly will help you to save some time in large projects design. About Nuxt.js one thing that let me down was you can't find many manual configurations to be done, instead the documentation guides you to follow the directory structure that is automatically generated when creating a new project."* **(Mysia Santana).**

We hope this  brief article can help you to spend  less time on setup and more time on what really matters: solving problems and building great apps with Vue JS, Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS. 

In our Gallery you will find some of our projects using those three frameworks.
