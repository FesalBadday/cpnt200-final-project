# **Vue.js**

If you are used to creating a lot of development projects, you have probably already wondered which tools would be the best and most efficient to assist in this function. Is it React, Vue or Angular?

Who knows that framework you hear so much about would not be the best choice, or maybe that one which has just been released,  would solve all your problems?

It's easy to get lost in the middle of so many options and end up making the wrong choices, and that's not a bad thing, as every mistake becomes new learning and improvement for the next project.

To help you with this decision, we'll talk about a very consolidated tool and with a large number of contributors, you may have heard about it: Vue.js.

For developers who have experience Vue.js and also for those who want to change areas, there are many opportunities with Vue.

To put it into context, we have to make it clear that this article is not about the perfect choice that will work for all cases without exception, even why this tool has yet to be created. We will be presented here a short overview about the  one of the most used and robust solutions used for creating websites and that, for sure, can be the solution to some of your current pains.

\*\*\*\*In the last two weeks we as Web Development students, at SAIT (Southern Institute of Technology), we have been exposed to several features of these three frameworks.\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*Our impressions and reviews: (to add/article)\*\*\*\*\*\*

1. Evan: Enjoyed learning Nuxt for the most part, I think because of the amount of time we had to learn it in class I’m still a little unsure of all the ins and outs. I enjoy doing Vue and working with components and the pages they load to. Tailwind seems interesting, I’m not sure if I enjoy using it but I guess we’ll see after this project! Maybe this site will look nice, maybe it’ll be a disgusting mess.
2. Fesal: I enjoyed working with Nuxt and I can see how it could save me time, like doing multiple pages and then just simply calling them from the components. I enjoyed working with both v-for and mustache syntaxes, I did work with v-html/v-text but in future, I don't see any benefit of using v-html/v-text over the mustache? also, one thing I did not like about the v-for is that it's not as simple as the regular for loop just like in JS, don't get me wrong, it's easy once you do it and you get it to work but I still prefer the regular for loop.
3. Mysia: What I've like most about this project was the usability of the components and how they work together...
4. Jean Marc: ?
